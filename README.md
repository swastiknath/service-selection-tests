# Instance Selection Algorithms: Comparative Benchmarks
#### Authors: Swastik Nath, Anushree Chakraborty, Soumyajit Pal

We perform comparative analysis of several performance metrics including but not limited to memory overheads, CPU utilization, Average Response Time, System Througput of certain Instance Selection Algorithms used in Microservices Mesh architecutures in different deployment scenarios such as with diffrent sidecar proxies/ proxyless models and hybrid models.
We also test the performance aspects of Centralized and Distributed Control Planes with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with In-Cluster versus Google Managed Control Planes.
